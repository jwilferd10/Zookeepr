## :wave: Description
Zookeepr is a platform built to showcase various animals and their respective zookeepers at their zoo. Users can search for specific animals and zookeepers, additionally users can also create and add each type to the local API.

### :globe_with_meridians: Open
From the start Zookeepr was built to further learning. Because of this, the repository is open and it's my hope that someone can view this codebase and find use from it.

### üí≠ Developer Notes
Originally built in 2020, this project emphasized learning how to use Express.js and middleware to interact with both the front and back end. Since then, Zookeepr has undergone updates to facilitate further learning and hands-on practice.

The challenge was to mimic a real-life scenario where Zookeepr, previously built using CommonJS, needed to be updated to use ES6 Modules. Additionally, the HTML template was updated to utilize semantic elements. 

### üôè Thank You!
So much for checking out Zookeepr. This project may be familiar to some people, but I've made the effort to go further and call this application my own. Thanks again and happy coding!
