## :wave: Description
### :page_with_curl: Manage and Explore Zoo Data
Zookeepr is a platform designed to showcase various animals and their respective zookeepers at the zoo. The data for both zookeepers and animals are stored in a JSON file. Using Express.js, users can access and interact with the API. The front-end code dynamically generates cards based on the API data, providing an interactive and seamless user experience.

### :heavy_plus_sign: Create and Search Zoo Records
Users can search for specific zookeepers and animals based on set parameters.  This allows for efficient and targeted searches within the zoo's database. Additionally, users can create and add new zookeepers and animals to the local API. This feature ensures that the platform remains up-to-date with the latest information and allows for continuous expansion of the zoo's records.

### :globe_with_meridians: Open
From the start Zookeepr was built to further learning. Because of this, the repository is open and it's my hope that someone can view this codebase and find use from it.

### üí≠ Developer Notes
Originally built in 2020, this project emphasized learning how to use Express.js and middleware to interact with both the front and back end. Since then, Zookeepr has undergone updates to facilitate further learning and hands-on practice.

The challenge was to mimic a real-life scenario where Zookeepr, previously built using CommonJS, needed to be updated to use ES6 Modules. Additionally, the HTML template was updated to utilize semantic elements. 

### üôè Thank You!
So much for checking out Zookeepr. This project may be familiar to some people, but I've made the effort to go further and call this application my own. Thanks again and happy coding!
